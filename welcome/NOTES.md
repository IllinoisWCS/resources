# Welcome Notes

## Welcome to Tech Team!

Hello! Welcome to Tech Team. We are Berwin and Emily, your two co-chairs for this school year and we're excited to have you join our committee under WCS!

Our goal as a committee is to provide a technical project experience for our members. You'll have two opportunities to present: once in mid-March at EOH, and once in April/May at the WCS Spring Banquet.

Let's go around and say your name, hometown, year in school, major and what you're most excited about for this year.

## Plans for the Year

We have a very busy and fun year planned for us. All experience levels welcome!

For the first 6-7 weeks of the fall semester, we will be having weekly tutorials. We have a pretty diverse set of tutorials developed for you. But this could definitely change if you all want something different. We are open to do tutorials on technologies that you want to see, and if we don't know much about it, we certainly can try our best to find someone who does know about it.

After the tutorials, we will have a brainstorming session regarding projects. We allow for two opportunities to present: individual presenter or group project. If at any point during the tutorials, you find the tutorial particularly interesting and you would like to expand on that tutorial or develop your own project, feel free to do so and you can present at EOH as an individual at our booth. We will also be brainstorming group projects we can work on too.

From there, once the brainstorming session has ended and we're set on a concrete list of projects, we will commence development work. During this time, we will have 2 meetings a week. One meeting during the week which will be a half an hour to an hour long. This meeting will serve as a status update meeting. We will also be doing some sharing of cool apps or projects we've noticed. Then, on the weekend, we will have a development meeting which will be about an hour to 2 hours long. This is a chance to work together with your peers, get unstuck, and of course, we will be here to help out and answer questions. We will have snacks :).

Our first presentation deadline is Engineering Open House. This is typically held in mid-March. We will have a booth set up and you can present the projects you're working on.

Our second presentation deadline is the WCS Spring Awards banquet. This is typically held in late April. It's a great opportunity to show what's changed after EOH regarding your projects.

## Tutorials

- Git
- Web Part I: Basic Website
- Web Part II: Data-binding
- Slackbot
- Web Part III: Adding a simple backend
- Chrome Extension
- Intro to Data Science with Python

All slides for the tutorials can be found at [illinoiswcs.org/tutorials](http://illinoiswcs.org/tutorials). We have skeleton and complete versions of our tutorials on the [IllinoisWCS](http://github.com/illinoiswcs) Github organization page.

We do have to make a disclaimer in that to make this the best experience for you, we chose not to do tutorials regarding technologies in which we didn't have sufficient experience to teach you on. Berwin and I mainly work with data-related tools and web-related development. Therefore, unfortunately, if you're interested in mobile development, we are unable to provide that experience. We do recommend, that if you are interested in this area, to go check out SigMobile, the mobile development organization under ACM.

## Logistics

We will have a mailing list strictly for announcements. Everyone who's signed in today, we will add to the list.

We will also have a Facebook group for any link sharing or general questions.

If at any point during the week you have a question or are stuck on something, WCS has office hours from 2 - 3pm every weekday. Berwin and I will be having our office hours in the WCS office on Monday and Wednesday. If you can't make it on our designated days, we have other officers staffing other days.

As well, feel free to email us or Facebook message us with any questions as well. We're here to help you and to make this the best experience for you!
